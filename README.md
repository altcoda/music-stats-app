# About

![music-stats-app preview](https://i.ibb.co/bmt6scM/Screenshot-2022-08-05-at-23-43-39-Music-Stats.png)

This is a music app created as an assignment for SoftUni's React course.

I used Back4App for the Backend and Parse SDK to retrieve and modify data. I opted out for writing the CSS by myself. React-Select is used for dropdowns.

# Features

- Uses the last.fm API to retrieve popular albums.
- Filter the albums by tag and search by album/artist name.
- Browse through pages with pagination.
- Create an account (option to request password reset).
- Under the Albums dropdown: submit albums and view them as well as modify them. You can also see albums from other users.
- Edit your profile with live preview.

# Setup

* The examiner is provided with the .env keys without which the app won't work.
* Clone the repository.
* Initialise with `npm i` to install dependencies
* You will need to create an `.env` file in the app root and add the values you have been provided with.
* Run with `npm start`
